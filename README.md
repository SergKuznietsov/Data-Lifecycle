# Data Lifecycle Project

This project is focused on the complete data lifecycle, including web scraping, data ingestion from various sources (CSV, XML, XLSX), data cleaning, database creation, and interactive reporting in Power BI.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Collection from Various Sources
   1.1. **Identify Target Websites and Data Sources**:
       - Define the websites for web scraping and the file paths for CSV, XML, and XLSX files.
   
   1.2. **Analyze the Structure of HTML Pages and Files**:
       - Use browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) to inspect HTML structure for web scraping.
       - Review the structure of CSV, XML, and XLSX files to identify the necessary data elements.
   
   1.3. **Develop Data Collection Scripts**:
       - **Web Scraping**: Gather data from web pages using Python libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`.
       - **CSV Import**: Collect data from CSV files.
       - **XML Import**: Collect data from XML files.
       - **XLSX Import**: Collect data from XLSX files.

   1.4. **Store Collected Data**:
       - Save the raw data in the respective formats within the `/raw_data/` directory.

### 2. Data Integration and Merging
   2.1. **Prepare Structure for Data Integration**:
       - Define the schema for the MetaData structure to hold combined data from all sources.
   
   2.2. **Create Script for Data Merging**:
       - Develop a script that merges data from CSV, XML, and XLSX into a single DataFrame, which is exported as `DataFrame.csv`.

### 3. Web Scraping for Additional Data
   - A Python web scraping script was used to extract additional data required for creating a unique Primary Key in the dataset.

### 4. Data Cleaning
   4.1. **Clean and Normalize Data**:
       - Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and correct anomalies in the data using Python scripts.
   
   4.2. **Format Data for Further Use**:
       - Ensure data consistency and format it appropriately for database storage and analysis.

### 5. Database Creation
   5.1. **Create SQLite Database**:
       - Define the database schema and create the necessary relational tables.
   
   5.2. **Import Cleaned Data into the Database**:
       - Load the cleaned data into the SQLite database.

### 6. Power BI Reporting
   6.1. **Export Database to Power BI**:
       - Use Python scripts to export the SQLite database for use in Power BI.
   
   6.2. **Create Visualizations**:
       - Build interactive reports and dashboards in Power BI using the imported SQLite data.

## Directory Structure

- **/raw_data/**: Contains the raw data collected from different sources (CSV, XML, XLSX).
- **/cleaned_data/**: Cleaned and processed data ready for analysis.
- **/scripts/**: Python scripts for data collection, merging, cleaning, and database management.
- **/visualizations/**: Output folder for storing visualizations generated from the data.
- **/notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data analysis.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project root directory.
3. Run the provided scripts in sequence as per the project plan.
4. Review the generated files in the corresponding folders.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `lxml`, `sqlite3`
- Basic understanding of web scraping, data analysis, and database management.
- Power BI Desktop for creating interactive reports.

## Usage

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Run `web_scraping.py` to collect data from web sources.
   - Run `csv_import.py`, `xml_import.py`, and `xlsx_import.py` to import data from CSV, XML, and XLSX files.

2. **Data Integration**:
   - Run `merge_data.py` to combine data into a single DataFrame.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Run `clean_data.py` to clean and normalize the data.

4. **Database Creation**:
   - Run `create_db.py` to create the SQLite database and import cleaned data.

5. **Power BI Reporting**:
   - Run `export_to_powerbi.py` to prepare the data for Power BI.
   - Create reports and dashboards in Power BI based on the SQLite database.
